This app implements my personal model for the stages of personal finance.

### Stage 1 - survival

Passing criteria: excess income > 0.

You need to have extra money at the end of the month.
You can either work more or spend less.

The subapp for stage 1 will help you plan shifts and budget.

###  Stage 2 - stable

Passing criteria: needs-to-excess are 2-to-1, 6 month emergency fund.

You need a lot extra at the end of the month.
Having a lot extra means you can quickly build a 6 month emergency fund,
    rebuild an emergency fund after an emergency,
    and pay off consumer debt in a more reasonable amount of time.
A credit card is NOT an emergency fund. It is a horrifying last resort.

The subapp for stage 2 is the same as stage 1.

### Stage ?

You need to pay off high interest debt.
Interest is extra money you pay to someone who lent you money you didn't have.
However, this extra money does not provide you anything else of value.
Paying off high interest debt will free up more of you CURRENT income.
That means you can build your wealth faster without having do anything else,
like find a new job or negotiate a pay raise.
I'm not saying a new job or a pay raise are bad things.
I'm pointing out that those outcomes depend on factors you cannot control.
