# money-dashboard

This app implements my personal model for the stages of personal finance.

### Stage 1

Passing criteria: excess income > 0.

You need to have extra money at the end of the month.
You can either work more or spend less.

The subapp for stage 1 will help you plan shifts and budget.

### Stage ?

You need to pay off high interest debt.
Interest is extra money you pay to someone who lent you money you didn't have.
However, this extra money does not provide you anything else of value.
Paying off high interest debt will free up more of you CURRENT income.
That means you can build your wealth faster without having do anything else,
like find a new job or negotiate a pay raise.
I'm not saying a new job or a pay raise are bad things.
I'm pointing out that those outcomes depend on factors you cannot control.
